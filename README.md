# Top Gun Challenge (Using SDL)

## Project Overview
The *Top Gun Challenge* is an interactive, plane shooting game where players control their plane to shoot down enemy aircraft while managing their fuel and health. The goal is to defeat enemy planes, score points, and advance through levels to become the ultimate ace pilot. This game is developed using the **SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)** for graphical representation and follows **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

## Objectives
- Develop a plane shooting game using **SDL** for graphics.
- Implement core **OOP principles** such as:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
  
## Features
- **Player Movement**: Control your plane on the screen.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Shoot at enemy planes.
